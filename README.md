# qn
qn is a text editor which is designed to be lightweight, easily modifiable, and entirely written in C.

Inspired by antirez's kilo, the idea is to write a text editor and explore C.

Writing a text editor will probably be boring, but by keeping the scope limited and the feature set small, I hope to be able to get back into C for a little bit and add some weights to my proverbial bat.
